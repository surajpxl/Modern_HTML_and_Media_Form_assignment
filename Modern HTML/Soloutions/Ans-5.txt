5. Write a short note on tab index.

Ans: Tabindex is a global attribute that allows an HTML element to receive focus. It needs a value of zero or a negative number in order to work in an accessible way. When tabindex 's value is set to zero or a positive number, the element can be navigated to via the keyboard's Tab key.

1- tabindex="0" -  this option allows elements that are not usually able to be focused via the keyboard to become focusable. This value of tabindex is particularly beneficial.

2- tabindex="-1" - this option enables elements that are not typically focusable to receive focus programmatically, such as through JavaScript, or as the target of links.
